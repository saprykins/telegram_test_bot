Free deployment  
Norht Europe
free tier - Standard B1s (1 vcpu, 1 GiB memory)
free tier - Storage
Initially, it was created with public IP, i connected to user qwerty_05112024, uploaded the code
NB: what you see in ssh isn't correlated with cloudshell vscode

There're costs related to public IP
i deleted it when VM stoped from network interfaces
i should connect via developer bastion (should be free - to be checked)
i could access only to user azureuser
NB: copy past was complicated
i used: 
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saprykins/telegram_test_bot/main/my_bot.py
copy paste + new lines for credentials

## ðŸ“ˆ Azure VM Capacity Tests  
This report summarizes tests on an Azure Standard B1s VM to see how it handles a bot under stress. The goal was to find its limits for a low-cost, free-tier VM.  

### Test Scenario & Results  
We tested the bot with two users: one user continuously sent requests to flood the bot, and another used it normally.  
  
The VM handled both users well. While the stress test caused brief spikes in CPU usage and network traffic, the VM stayed stable and kept responding to the normal user. This shows the Standard B1s can manage sudden, heavy workloads.  

### Conclusion  

The Standard B1s is a enough for a bot that have few users.  

The charts below illustrate the VM's behavior during the two-user stress test.

<!--
Tests
One can flud the bot with many messages, it stops receiveing it, then it replies
If another user text the bot, another user receives a feedback.
